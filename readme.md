Mini Project2 Sorkel

Project Goal
===

<p>Analysis about the state of the art of a particular topic (typically, topic you did not take classes in)<p>
<p>In group discussion of your results<p>
<p>Joint presentations to class by the group<p>
  
MVP & Users' Story
===
#### Minimum Viable Product(MVP): 
<p>Labeling the data by using the Snorkel API;<p>
<p>Clustering the tweets based on the similarity.<p>

#### User Story: 
<p>As a tweeter, I want to filter the fake tweets of disasters;<p>
<p>As a student in computational linguistics, I want to know usersâ€™ understanding about the words describing a real disaster.<p>

Introduction to the topic
====
<p> Unsupervised learning can be considered as a way to reduce the dimensions. Most of the unsupervised learning are a form of cluster analysis: some objects in the clusters are very similar while others are distinct. <p>
<p> Weak supervision can successfully avoid it by using subject matter experts (SMEs). We can achieve weak supervision in three ways: (1) providing higher-level, less precise supervision; (2) giving cheaper, lower-quality supervision; (3) taking existing resources. <p>

Summary of references
===
<p> New Snorkel(Snorkelv0.9) has three important functions. The goal of snorkel is to finish the operations of practitioners in the training data.<p>

<p>Snorkel can be used in two contrast applications: Natural Language & Images. Hancock, Braden et al. (2018) introduced the Babble Labble in natural language, a framework with semantic parser converting explanations into executable functions. While Varma Paroma et al. (2017) presented Coral, a paradigm is allowing users to write heuristics to label training data to interpret the raw pixels. <p>

Analysis of results including pros and cons.  This may include duplicating results by running example SW or testing public SW.

Recommendations for a person who want to develop or use such systems
===
<p> 1. Use a third-party Knowledgebase after being familiar with the labeling. <p>
<p> 2. Try the dataset in your native language. <p>
<p> 3. Add more complex models. <p>
